# Development

Development should follow [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to foster some shared responsibility.

* Fork/branch the repository
* Make changes
* Fix all Rubocop (`rubocop`) and Foodcritic (`foodcritic .`) offenses
* Write smoke tests that reasonably cover the changes (`kitchen verify`)
* Pass all smoke tests
* Submit a Pull Request using Github
* Wait for feedback and merge from a second developer
